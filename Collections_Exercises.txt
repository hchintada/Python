Collections exercise:

1) Write a program to check whether each element in a given list is greater than 
   the one preceding it.

2) A list of integers is said to be a valley if it consists of a sequence of 
   strictly decreasing values followed by a sequence of strictly increasing
   values. The decreasing and the increasing sequences must be of length
   atleast 2. The last value of the decreasing sequence is the first value
   of the increasing sequence. 
   
   Write a program to check if a list is a valley.

3) A two dimensional matrix can be represented in Python row-wise, as a list of lists:
   each inner list represents one row of the matrix. For instance, the matrix
   1 2 3
   4 5 6
   can be represented as [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]].
   
   The transpose of a matrix makes each row into a column.

   Write a program to that takes a row-wise matrix in form of list as shown above and
   returns its transpose.

   Ex: [[4,5,6],[6,7,8]] --> [[4,6],[5,7],[6,8]]
