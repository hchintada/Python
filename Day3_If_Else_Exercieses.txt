Day 3 If_else exercises:

1) Assume you are creating a program for a bank's ATM machine. Now, using the if-else statement,
write a program that checks whether the withdrawal amount is greater or less than the balance 
in the account. If it is greater than the balance, the program should display 'Insufficient
Funds'. If withdrawal amount is less than the balance, it should display 'please collect 
cash' and update the balance by subtracting the withdrawal amount from the balance.

2) Write a program to output the session of the day. If the time is 4 AM to 12 AM it should output
'Morning'. If the time is between 12AM to 5PM, it should output 'Afternoon'. If time is between
5PM to 8PM it should output 'Evening'. If it is between 8PM to 4AM, it should to output 'Night'.
